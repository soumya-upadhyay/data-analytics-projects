## 📌 Project Overview

This case study focuses on uncovering actionable insights from a sample healthcare dataset using Advanced Microsoft Excel techniques. The aim was to understand patterns in disease-related costs, hospital stay durations, and medication usage across demographics.

**Objectives:**
- Demonstrate proficiency in Power Query and Pivot Tables.
- Generate clean and structured data ready for analysis.
- Derive key insights that can be used to improve healthcare policy and operations.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used

- **Microsoft Excel**
  - **Power Query**: For cleaning and transforming raw data.
  - **Pivot Tables**: To analyze categorical and numerical data.
  - **Pivot Charts**: To visualize trends, patterns, and anomalies.
  - **Core Functions**: SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, VLOOKUP, etc.

## 📊 Key Insights

### 🔬 Disease-Specific Cost Analysis
- Identified diseases that drive the highest treatment costs.
- Demonstrated how **age** and **gender** influence healthcare spending across disease categories.
- Highlighted chronic illnesses with a **disproportionate financial burden** on the healthcare system.

### 🏨 Hospital Stay Patterns
- Analyzed **patient volume** and **average length of hospital stays** by diagnosis.
- Identified a large number of **short-term hospital stays**, particularly for non-critical illnesses.
- Mapped hospital resource usage patterns across **different demographics**.

## ✅ Recommendations

### 1. Implement a Disease-Centric Resource Allocation Strategy
- Prioritize funding and operational attention toward diseases with the highest financial and systemic impact.
- Consider targeted intervention programs for high-cost chronic illnesses.

### 2. Optimize Operational Processes for High-Volume, Short-Term Stays
- Improve **care pathways and discharge processes** in departments with frequent, short-duration admissions.
- Explore **telemedicine** or outpatient services for conditions that do not require extended hospitalization.
