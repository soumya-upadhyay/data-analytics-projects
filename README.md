### 🧠 Approach

1.  **Data Cleaning and Manipulation in Power Query Editor:**
    * Handled missing values, standardized data types, and cleaned text fields.
    * Extracted relevant information from complex columns (e.g., release years).

2.  **Loading Data and Creating a Model:**
    * Loaded the cleaned data into Power BI's data model.
    * Established relationships between tables to ensure accurate filtering and analysis across the dashboard.

3.  **Visualizations:**
    * Designed a dashboard with a variety of visuals (e.g., line charts, bar graphs, and slicers) to represent different aspects of the data.
    * Each chart was created to directly address one of the problem statements.

4.  **Data Storytelling:**
    * Translated the visual insights into a clear narrative that explains the key trends and findings.
    * The final dashboard serves as a tool for stakeholders to explore the data and get actionable insights.
