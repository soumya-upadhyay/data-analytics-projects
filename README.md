# 📈 CPI Inflation Trend Analysis – India (2017–2024)

This project explores and analyzes India’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) trends between 2017 and 2024. It was completed as part of my Data Analytics course with **Coding Ninjas** to practice Excel-based data analysis and insight generation.

## 🔍 Problem Statements

The goal was to analyze and answer the following questions:

1. **Which major categories contributed the most to CPI inflation?**
2. **How has CPI changed year-on-year since 2017?**
3. **What are the monthly price shifts within the Food basket?**
4. **What impact did COVID-19 have on inflation patterns?**
5. **How do global economic factors like oil prices affect India’s CPI?**

## 💡 Why I Chose This Project

This dataset was shared with us to apply our skills in Excel, but I chose to go beyond by:
- Interpreting real-world economic scenarios
- Connecting macroeconomic patterns with CPI movement
- Building a narrative that blends data + storytelling

## 🧠 Approach

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   Standardized monthly CPI data, removed missing values, restructured categories.

2. **Analysis using Pivot Tables**  
   Summarized values for categories, identified high-impact months/years.

3. **Visualization**  
   Created clean, reader-friendly line charts and bar graphs to show:
   - Category-wise inflation contribution
   - COVID-19 vs. pre/post trend shifts
   - Food sub-basket changes
   - Global event correlation using proxy variables (e.g., oil price years)

4. **Insight Synthesis**  
   Interpreted the findings in business/economic language to make them relevant for decision-makers.

## ✅ Key Takeaways

- **Food, Transport, and Housing** had the most volatile CPI trends.
- **COVID-19 led to a spike in essentials and a dip in recreation/amusement.**
- **Oil prices strongly correlated** with Transport and Household CPI categories.
- India's **inflation basket is sensitive to both domestic and global shocks.**

## 📌 Recommendations (from the project)

- Strengthen policy around food price stabilization.
- Monitor transport cost inflation more closely, especially during global oil volatility.
- Create early warning indicators for categories prone to external shocks.
