# 📊 Data Analytics Portfolio – Soumya Upadhyay

Welcome! This repository showcases a curated selection of data analytics projects I've worked on as part of my transition into the data analytics field. These projects reflect my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize data using tools like **Excel**, **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **Python**, and to derive insights that support decision-making.

I’m currently working as a Programmatic Analyst at IPG Mediabrands, handling the **Royal Caribbean International** client, and pursuing a Data Analytics certification with Coding Ninjas. This portfolio reflects my learning journey and interest in solving real-world business problems with data.
